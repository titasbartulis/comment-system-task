# Comment System Task

This repository hosts a dynamic, interactive web application designed to facilitate user engagement through a comment system. Built with a combination of PHP and JavaScript, the backend and frontend work in tandem to allow users to post comments, respond to discussions, and engage with content. The integration with MySQL ensures persistent storage and retrieval of user interactions, while Bootstrap 5 is utilized to create an intuitive and responsive user interface.

## Features

- Users can add new comments to a discussion thread.
- A reply feature enables users to respond directly to first-level comments, encouraging interactive dialogue.
- To keep the user interface straightforward, nested replies beyond the first level are not implemented.
- Bootstrap 5 provides a responsive layout, ensuring the comment system is accessible across various devices and screen sizes.
- JavaScript enhances the user experience with dynamic content updates, allowing for real-time interaction without the need for page reloads.
